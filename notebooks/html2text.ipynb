It is illegal in most places for someone to record you\\nwithout proper notice, but that doesn\\'t always mean that you\\'re not being\\nrecorded. If you feel like you’re being recorded, conduct a thorough physical\\nsearch and use the technology available to you to detect hidden cameras and\\nmicrophones.\\n\\n##  Steps\\n\\n###\\n\\nMethod 1\\n\\nConducting a Physical Search\\n\\n  1. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 1](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/92/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)\\n\\n1\\n\\n**Listen for a quiet buzzing or clicking noise to detect a recording device.**\\nHidden cameras are designed to be as discrete as possible, but many will still\\nemit a slight sound when they are working. When the area of suspected\\nsurveillance is as quiet as possible, walk around slowly to listen out for any\\nbuzzing or slight clicking noises that might be coming from a hidden\\ncamera.[1]\\n\\n    * Try searching the room late at night to reduce the ambient sound in the room. This will make isolating and locating any noises much easier.\\n    * There are plenty of different mechanical and electrical devices that can make quiet buzzing and clicking noises. Combine this method with other ways of identifying hidden cameras and microphones to differentiate between malicious and ordinary items.\\n\\n  2. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 2](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/57/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)\\n\\n2\\n\\n**Investigate your smoke detectors and other electronics.** Surveillance\\ndevices can be hidden inside other devices that require electricity, such as\\nsmoke detectors. Take your smoke detector down from the ceiling and look for a\\nmicrophone or camera inside. Check your speakers, lamps, and other electronics\\nfor signs of tampering that may indicate someone added a microphone.[2]\\n\\n    * Smoke detectors are a perfect place for microphones to be hidden as they have built-in power and are normally centralized in a room.\\n    * Microphones or cameras hidden inside smoke detectors or other electronics will usually be easily visible. Look for anything that doesn\\'t seem to be attached to the rest of the device, or anything that looks like a microphone or camera.\\n\\n  3. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 3](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/34/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)\\n\\n3\\n\\n**Look for decorations that seem strange or out of place.** One of the most\\ncommon ways of hiding a microphone or camera in a room is by hiding it in\\nsomething inconspicuous, such as a teddy bear or a vase of flowers. Look\\naround the room for any decorations that seem like they don’t fit with the\\nrest of the space, or that are angled in peculiar ways.[3]\\n\\n    * While most of a camera can be hidden inside something else, the lens will almost always need to be completely visible for the camera to work. Check your suspicious decorations for glassy surfaces or visible lenses that might indicate a hidden camera.\\n    * The most effective cameras will be positioned so that they can see as much of the room as possible. Look for decorations on the edges of the room that are angled awkwardly to face into the room.\\n    * Hidden microphones will work best when they’re in the center of a room, so they can hear everything equally. Look for decorations positioned on a table in the middle of your room to find hidden microphones.\\n\\n  4. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 4](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/19/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)\\n\\n4\\n\\n**Check for peculiar wires or wires that don’t lead anywhere.** While some\\nshort-term surveillance devices might be battery-powered, most hidden cameras\\nand microphones will need some sort of power supply. Look around your\\nelectronics and power outlets for wires leading into anything that doesn’t\\nneed power, or wires that you don’t recognize.[4]\\n\\n    * If you find an unfamiliar wire and can’t work out what it is powering, you should unplug it immediately.\\n\\n  5. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 5](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)\\n\\n5\\n\\n**Build a[ **hidden camera detector**](/Build-a-Hidden-Camera-Detector \"Build\\na Hidden Camera Detector\") to find well-hidden devices.** A hidden camera\\ndetector will make it easier to detect pinhole cameras hidden in walls or\\nobjects. Place an empty toilet paper tube over one eye and hold a flashlight\\nin front of the other. Turn off the lights, turn on the flashlight, and look\\naround the room slowly for small glimmers of light.[5]\\n\\n    * The light will reflect off of the charge coupled device or lens on the camera, making it easier to notice.\\n    * Once you identify a glimmer, take a closer look at the object to see if it might be a camera. Some reflective objects will let off a glimmer without it meaning they’re hiding a camera.\\n    * Some cameras might also have small LED lights that will activate in the dark. These should also be easily visible through a hidden camera detector.\\n\\n  6. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 6](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ac/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)\\n\\n6\\n\\n**Look around light fixtures and the battery in your vehicle.** Cameras and\\nmicrophones can be hidden in your car to record or track you. Check inside any\\nlight fixtures or around your vehicle\\'s battery for any unfamiliar wires or\\ndevices. Use a flashlight to look under your car, checking for anything that\\nseems to be stuck onto the vehicle rather than part of it.[6]\\n\\n    * It\\'s rare for there to be wires coming off of the contact points on your battery. Carefully investigate any strange wires, avoiding coming in contact with the battery where you can.\\n    * The only device inside your light fixture should be the lightbulb itself. It may also help to take a look inside and around the lightbulb to see if the bulb itself is bugged.\\n    * All of the methods used for detecting hidden cameras and microphones in your home will also work when looking for them in your car.\\n\\n  7. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 7](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)\\n\\n7\\n\\n**Use a flashlight to[ **check for two-way mirrors**](/Tell-if-a-Mirror-Is-\\nTwo-Way-or-Not \"Tell if a Mirror Is Two Way or Not\").** Two-way mirrors look\\nlike a mirror on one side and a window from the other, which makes them\\nperfect for hiding cameras. If you suspect a mirror is two-way, turn off the\\nlights in the room and press a flashlight against the glass. If it’s a two-way\\nmirror, you’ll be able to see the room on the other side.[7]\\n\\n    * Try lifting the mirror off of the wall. Two-way mirrors have to be installed in the wall or bolted to it, where regular mirrors might just be hung on a hook.\\n    * Another way to detect a two-way mirror is by tapping on it. A regular mirror will produce a dull, flat sound, whereas a two-way mirror will sound sharper, open, or hollow due to the room behind it.\\n    * If you suspect you have a two-way mirror, the easiest way to deal with it is to cover it up with a sheet, some paper, or even by hanging another mirror over it.\\n\\n###\\n\\nMethod 2\\n\\nSearching for Electrical Signals\\n\\n  1. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 8](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/88/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-8.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-8.jpg)\\n\\n1\\n\\n**Sweep the area with an RF detector.** RF detectors allow you to scan for\\nradio frequencies used to transmit from hidden cameras and microphones.\\nPurchase an RF detector online or from your local electronics store and wave\\nit around the area you think is bugged. The detector will give off a small\\nbeeping or crackling sound when pointed at an item giving off radio\\nfrequencies.[8]\\n\\n    * You’ll need to turn off any other devices that broadcast radio signals in order for the RF detector to work.\\n    * Check the manufacturer’s guidelines for more information on how to use your RF detector.\\n    * When the RF detector beeps or crackles, look around the area to find the hidden surveillance device.\\n\\n  2. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 9](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/08/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-9.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-9.jpg)\\n\\n2\\n\\n**Listen for interference when making a call.** Many hidden cameras and\\nmicrophones will make a small electromagnetic field as they transmit data.\\nMake a call on your cellphone and walk around the room while you talk. If you\\nhear any crackling, clicking, or buzzing on the phone, it might be a sign that\\nyou’re entering the field of a surveillance device.[9]\\n\\n    * Move your phone around the are where you think the hidden camera or microphone is to get a better sense of its exact location. The buzzing, clicking, and crackling should get louder on the phone as you get closer to the device.\\n    * There are many other devices, such as speakers, television sets, and radios that might create small electromagnetic fields as well. Turn these off when searching for hidden devices.\\n    * You can perform a similar check with an AM/FM radio. Place the radio near the location where the microphone is hidden and turn the dial, listening for any strange interference or static.\\n\\n  3. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 10](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ee/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-10.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-10.jpg)\\n\\n3\\n\\n**Use a digital or smartphone camera to look for infrared lights.** Most\\nsmartphone and digital cameras can see infrared light that isn’t visible to\\nthe human eye, and which can be used by hidden cameras. Scan your camera\\naround the room and look through the display for any unexpected light sources\\nor flashes, which might point to a hidden camera.[10]\\n\\n    * You can check if your camera can detect infrared light by pointing a TV remote at it and pressing a button. You should see a small flicker of light on the end of the TV remote from the infrared light.\\n\\n  4. ![Image titled Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones Step 11](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/01/Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-11.jpg/aid230470-v4-728px-Detect-Hidden-Cameras-and-Microphones-Step-11.jpg)\\n\\n4\\n\\n**Look for strange Wi-Fi signals on your phone or computer.** Some modern\\ncameras and microphones will transmit data over the internet, meaning they can\\nbe accessed from almost anywhere. However, they’ll often also have Wi-Fi\\nsignals. Search for available Wi-Fi signals on your phone or laptop and look\\nfor any that seem unexpected or suspicious.[11]\\n\\n    * The default Wi-Fi name for a lot of hidden cameras will be the product code for the device. Search for any unknown Wi-Fi names online to see what kind of device they belong to.\\n    * As well as peculiar Wi-Fi names, you can look for Wi-Fi signals that are stronger than you anticipated. A strong signal normally indicates that the device is nearby.\\n    * If you have access to the wireless router, you may be able to log in and see which devices are connected to your network. Remove access to any devices you didn’t set up to keep your network secure.\\n\\n##\\n\\nCommunity Q&A\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nAdd New Question\\n\\n  * Question\\n\\nIs it possible for people to watch me from their phones?\\n\\nCommunity Answer\\n\\nYes, they could be watching/recording you from the camera app in their phone.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nYes No\\n\\nNot Helpful 82 Helpful 467\\n\\n  * Question\\n\\nMy landlord at random times insists on changing the air filter.
